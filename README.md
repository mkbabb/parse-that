# Parse That [Thang](https://oldinterneticons.tumblr.com/post/679136268174688256/go-mouse-fuck-that-thang)

Parser combinators for TypeScript. Write your language in EEBNF (extended extended
backus-naur form) and parse it with ease. Handles left recursion, right recursion, and
left factoring.

Does what basically every other parser combinator library does, with a few extra
features and optimizations. Focused on performance as much as possible, though
combinators are always going to be slower than a custom flattened parser.

## Usage

Simple example:

```ts
import { string, match } from "@mkbabb/parse-that";

const heyy = match(/hey+t/);
heyy.parse("heyyyyyyyyyt"); // => "heyyyyyyyyyt"
```

Or with a grammar:

```ts
import { string, match, generateParserFromEBNF } from "@mkbabb/parse-that";

const grammar = `
    expr = term, { ("+" | "-"), term };
    term = factor, { ("*" | "/"), factor };
    factor = number | "(", expr, ")";
    number = /[0-9]+/;
    whatzupwitu = "whatzupwitu";
`;

const [nonterminals, ast] = generateParserFromEBNF(grammar);
const expr = nonterminals.expr;
expr.parse("1 + whatzupwitu * 3"); // => [1, "+", ["whatzupwitu", "*", 3]]
```

nice.

## Performance

As stated earlier, parser combinators using closures like this are always going to be
"slow" - at least in JavaScript. But it's perhaps not as bad as you think. Here's a
benchmark comparing the following libraries, all parsing the same `JSON` grammar:

-   [Chevrotain](https://github.com/chevrotain/chevrotain)
-   [Parsimmon](https://github.com/jneen/parsimmon)
-   this library, with standard combinators: [here](test/json.test.ts)
-   this library, using a generated parser from EEBNF: [here](test/ebnf.test.ts)

The file used is a 3.8 MB `JSON` file, containing ~10K lines of `JSON`. Whitespace is
randomly inserted to make the file a bit more difficult to parse (makes the file about
5x the size). The benchmark is run 100 times, and the average is taken.

### Results

| name       | hz     | min    | max    | mean   | p75    | p99    | p995   | p999   | rme    | samples |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------- |
| Standard   | 8.1013 | 119.20 | 127.90 | 123.44 | 127.08 | 127.90 | 127.90 | 127.90 | Â±2.64% | 10      |
| EEBNF      | 5.1979 | 183.18 | 216.12 | 192.38 | 195.59 | 216.12 | 216.12 | 216.12 | Â±3.97% | 10      |
| Chevrotain | 6.8699 | 129.91 | 167.46 | 145.56 | 158.21 | 167.46 | 167.46 | 167.46 | Â±5.70% | 10      |
| Parsimmon  | 4.0256 | 246.69 | 250.34 | 248.41 | 249.09 | 250.34 | 250.34 | 250.34 | Â±1.54% | 10      |

##### hz: ops/sec - higher is better

    Standard - test/benchmarks/json.bench.ts > JSON Parser
        1.18x faster than Chevrotain
        1.56x faster than EEBNF
        2.01x faster than Parsimmon

Probably not the most scientific comparison, but it's generally about 10-30% faster than
the rest.

Have a look inside [benchmarks](./test/benchmarks) if you're curious.

## Debugging

Debugging is made ðŸŒˆprettyðŸŒˆ by using the `debug` combinator - but you must run in
`development` mode (`vite build --mode development`) to see the output.

![image](./assets/debug.png)

As output, you'll see a few things:

-   A header containing:
    -   parsing status (`Ok` or `Err`)
    -   current offset into the input string
    -   debug node's name
    -   stringified current parser - a bit like the EEBNF format
-   A body containing:
    -   A maximum of 10 lines of the input string, with the current offset into the
        parse string denoted by `^`
    -   Line numbers for each line currently displayed

The `blue` color indicates that that variable is an EEBNF nonterminal - `yellow` is the
stringified parser.

## EEBNF and the Great Parser Generator

Extended Extended Backus-Naur Form is a simple and readable way to describe a language.
A [better](https://dwheeler.com/essays/dont-use-iso-14977-ebnf.html) EBNF.

See the EEBNF for EEBNF (meta right) at [eebnf.ebnf](./grammar/eebnf.ebnf).

With your grammar in hand, call the `generateParserFromEBNF` function within
[ebnf.ts](./src/ebnf.ts) and you'll be returned two objects:

```ts
[nonterminals, ast]: [EBNFNonterminals, EBNFAST] = generateParserFromEBNF(grammar);
```

a JavaScript object containing all of the parsed nonterminals in your language, and the
AST for your language. Each nonterminal is a `Parser` object - use it as you would any
other parser.

Fully featured, and self-parsing, so the EEBNF parser-generator is written in EEBNF.
Checkout the self-parsing example (+ formatting), at
[eebnf.test.ts](./test/ebnf.test.ts).

### Key differences with EBNF

It's a mesh between your run-of-the-mill EBNF and
[W3C's EBNF](https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-notation). So stuff like `?` and `*` are
allowed - but it also supports `[ ]` and `{ }` for optional and repeated elements.

Set-like subtraction is supported, so you can do things like `a - b` to mean "a, but not
b".

Here's a list of operators:

-   `A?` | `[ A ]`: optional A
-   `A*` | `{ A }`: repeated A (0 or more)
-   `A+`: repeated A (1 or more)
-   `A | B`: A or B - higher precedence than `A, B`
-   `A, B`: A followed by B
-   `A - B`: A, but not B
-   `A >> B`: A, then B, but only return B
-   `A << B`: A, then B, but only return A
-   `( A )`: grouping - maximum precedence

And yes emojis are supported. Epsilon even has a special value for it - `Îµ` (or just use
the word epsilon).

### Formatting, syntax highlighting, & more

With the EEBNF parser generator you basically get formatting for free. Call the
`formatEBNF` function within [ebnf.ts](./src/ebnf.ts) and you'll be returned a string
containing the formatted EEBNF.

```ts
const formattedGrammar: string = formatEBNF(grammar);
```

## Left recursion & more

This library fully supports left recursion (either direct or indirect) and highly
ambiguous grammars.

So grammars like (trivial direct left recursion):

```ebnf
expr = expr , "+" , expr
     | integer
     | string ;
```

and like (highly ambiguous grammar):

```ebnf
ms = "s";
mSL = ( mSL , mSL , ms ) ? ;

mz = "z" ;
mZ = mZ | mY | mz ;

mY = mZ, mSL ;
```

are supported fully supported.

Our scheme is multifaceted and optimized depending upon a few factors:

#### Using EEBNF

Since EEBNF allows for one to easily grab ahold of the AST, we can optimize its
structure rather easily. Left recursion is "removed" (it's actually just factored out)
using a four-pass algorithm:

-   1. Sort the nonterminals topologically
-   2. Remove indirect left recursion
-   3. Remove left recursion
-   4. Factorize

For the above example each pass would look something like this:

Input grammar:

```ebnf
expr = expr , "+" , expr
     | integer
     | string ;
```

Sorted & removed left recursion:

```ebnf
expr = integer, expr_0
     | string, expr_0 ;
expr_0 = "+" , expr , expr_0
        | Îµ ;
```

Factorized:

```ebnf
expr = (integer | string) , expr_0 ;
expr_0 = "+" , expr , expr_0
        | Îµ
```

If any remaining left recursion is found, it's handled via the combinators.

#### Combinator support

Left recursion can be handled via two combinators: `memoize` and `mergeMemos`.
`mergeMemos` must be applied directly one's left-recursive call, and `memoize` must be
applied to the entire parser.

Here's an example:

```ts
...
const expression = Parser.lazy(() =>
    all(expression, operators.then(expression).opt()).mergeMemos().or(number)
)
    .memoize();
...
```

How this is done under the hood is by using a memoization table and a few clever tricks
to detect if the current parser is in a left-recursive call. See the
[left recursion](./docs/left-recursion.md) document for more information, and the
[memoization tests](./test/memoize.test.ts) for examples.

#### Caveats

Though left recursion is supported, it's absolutely not optimal. If it can be factored
out via the EEBNF parser generator generally the performance will quite fine, but if it
cannot you may run into some performance issues. This stems, among other things,
primarily from JavaScript's lack of tail call optimization. Again, see the
[left recursion](./docs/left-recursion.md) document for more information.
